## Data Analysis Overview

We started from the premise that our employing start-up company has a
limited budget to invest in a new movie. Even if sufficient funds were
available, it is safe to assume that only a fraction would be invested
initially. Without specific details, we limited the budget to $6 million.

Our data analysis suggests very distinct pathways for investing into a
new movie. Here we present the most important aspects that can influence
profitability: in which weeks of the year to release, in which countries
to produce, which producing companies to work with or emulate for
marketing, and which movie genres to consider.

Further analysis of the data is readily available and could include
details like which directors, screenwriters and producers to looks for,
which crew to hire (down to sound directors and costume designers).
However some further information is required first to narrow down the
vast possibilities available:

 - what is the range of budget available?

 - are we looking for a safe, modest profit or are we targeting a larger
 profit?

 - is producing in another country a viable option? (e.g. China or Japan)
